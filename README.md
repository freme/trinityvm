getting up to speed with github pages
=====================================

* check your ruby version `ruby --version`
* install bundler `gem install bundler`
* install jekyll and all needed dependencies `bundle install`
 * the magic is in the `Gemfile`, for details look there
* to run jenkyll locally, `bundle exec jekyll serve`
* github only looks at the gh-pages branch for updates to your website, just use the script `update-pages` to rebase everything to the gh-pages branch
