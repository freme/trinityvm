The VM provided can be used to learn the basics of how to analyze RNA-Seq data, including genome-based and genome-free transcript reconstruction and differential expression analysis. 

Below, we provide materials to help get you started. 

A VirtualBox virtual machine image is provided that includes several popular tools for analyzing RNA-Seq, including Tuxedo for genome-based and Trinity for genome-free RNA-Seq studies, and small sample RNA-Seq data sets.

Hands-on tutorials guide users in a step-by-step analysis of these data.
